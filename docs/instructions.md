## String
Strings are really just arrays of integers, but some operations are oriented towards strings anyway.  In these contexts, 0 is usually converted to 32, so that 0 can be used as a space in addition to its normal codepoint.

## Registers
op                  	|Description
---                 	|---
`x`                 	|Value of register x.  Default is parsed integer value from standard input, or 0.
`X`                 	|Peek and write register x.
<code>&#124;x</code>	|Decrement register x and push.  If x is not an integer, set it to 0 first.
<code>&#124;X</code>	|Increment register x and push.  If x is not an integer, set it to 0 first.
`y`                 	|Value of register y.  Default is first line of standard input.
`Y`                 	|Peek and write register y.
<code>&#124;y</code>	|Decrement register y and push.  If y is not an integer, set it to 0 first.
<code>&#124;Y</code>	|Increment register y and push.  If y is not an integer, set it to 0 first.

## Prefix Directives
Some instructions behave differently when they are the first character in a program.  These directives do not apply if the implicit eval of standard input succeeded.

char	|Name        	|Description
--- 	|---         	|---
`f` 	|line-filter 	|Use the rest of the program to filter input lines.  Print lines that produce a truthy result.
`F` 	|line-foreach	|Execute the rest of the program once for each line of input.
`m` 	|line-map    	|Map each line of standard input.  Print each result with a newline.
`i` 	|no-eval     	|Suppress auto-eval.  e.g. If the input is a binary number, this will prevent incorrectly parsing it as an integer.
